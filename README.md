# Scentronix web frontend

# Requirement

- Neatly written and formatted code for production level environment (scalability in mind)
- Demonstration of knowledge on libary setup eg. MUI
- Demonstration of knowledge on React
- Demonstration of knowledge on Typescript
- Demonstration of NextJS best practices
- Demonstration of data/api setup and integration

# Demonstration

- Website is using Typescript
- Using NextJS and TailwindCSS
- Using React
- Using Material UI ( Material Icons ). From the project I don't feel the need of using any MaterialUI component or split things into component just yet. If the need for reuse arise I would use it.
- I don't know what to do with API data / setup. However, you can look at another one of my project which also listed publicly [here](https://github.com/doraeminemon/traffic-weather-ui/tree/main) to get an idea how I would implement it.
